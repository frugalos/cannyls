Coding Standards
-----------------

You must apply the latest `rustfmt` (formtter) and `clippy` (linter) as follows:

```console
$ cargo fmt --all
$ cargo clippy
```

If any warnings are emitted, you need to fix them.

For other coding styles that can not be covered with the above tools, follow [Rust's Style Guildelines] as much as possible.
